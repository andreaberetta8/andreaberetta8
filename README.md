# Hi there, nice to meet you 👋

I'm Andrea Beretta and I'm a Computer Science  Graduate at Università degli Studi di Milano. I just graduated with a Bachelor Thesis about NLP, called 'Development of an application for natural language processing'. During these years i discovered my passion for the engineering side of data, so i decided to dive deeper into this world and i enrolled in a Data Science Master degree. I had to thank the course of Data management for this because it allowed me to discover this beautiful field that was unknown to me.
